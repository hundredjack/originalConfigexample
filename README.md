# 3D Model Configurator

A powerful 3D model customization tool built with React, Three.js, and related libraries. This project allows users to customize 3D models (shirt or cube) by changing colors, applying decals, and positioning them anywhere on the model surface.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: Choose between a shirt or cube model
- **360Â° Model Rotation**: Rotate models to view and customize from any angle
- **Decal Placement**: Place decals anywhere on the model surface
- **Decal Dragging**: Precisely position decals by dragging them
- **Color Customization**: Choose from a variety of colors for the model
- **Custom Image Upload**: Upload your own images to use as decals
- **Download**: Save your customized design as an image

## How to Use

1. **Model Controls**:
   - Switch between shirt and cube models
   - Toggle between model rotation and decal movement modes
   - Select colors to change the model appearance

2. **Decal Controls**:
   - Choose from pre-made decals or upload your own image
   - When decal movement is ON: Click and drag to position decals on the model
   - When decal movement is OFF: Click and drag to rotate the model

3. **Utilities**:
   - Download your customized design as an image
   - Toggle debug mode for advanced users

## Technical Implementation

- **Raycasting**: Decals can be placed anywhere on the model using raycasting to determine surface intersection points
- **Surface Normal Alignment**: Decals automatically align with the surface normal for proper orientation
- **Local Coordinate System**: Decals maintain their position during model rotation by using local model coordinates
- **Drag Handling**: Specialized drag handling prevents decals from jumping to unintended positions

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering library
- **@react-three/fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei**: Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **Valtio**: State management
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library
